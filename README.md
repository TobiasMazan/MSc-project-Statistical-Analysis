# MSc project: Statistical Analysis (Microstructure) 

__1. Project overview__

Automotive bearings designed for hard operating conditions: high loads, temperatures and sliding velocities combined with corrosive environment must be both durable and exhibiting low friction. This calls for special type of microstructure that should be studied in detail for further product development purposes.

In this project goal was to collect experimental data and perform quantitative analysis of material microstructure. Material studied has been a special kind of cerametallic composite. Mechanical and tribological properties have been described, advanced microstructure observations have been carried out. Then, using techniques of computer image analysis, attributes such as additive particles distribution, their size, shape, orientation and volume share have been computed. In the end statistical analysis and interpretation of resulting data have been carried out. 

Solution utilized graphics editor (GIMP) and GUI statistical analysis packages (MicroMeter, MS Excel, STAT_STUD).
