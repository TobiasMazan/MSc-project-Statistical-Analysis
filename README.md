# Statistical-microstructure-characterization-project

__1. Project overview__

Automotive bearings designed for hard operating conditions: high loads, temperatures and sliding velocities combined with corrosive environment must be both durable and exhibiting low friction. This calls for special type of microstructure that should be studied in detail for further product development purposes.

In this project goal was to collect experimental data and perform data science of material microstructure characterization with statistical and computer image analysis. Material studied has been Cu matrix composite material with the addition of CaF2 solid lubricant. Mechanical and tribological properties have been described; 
hardness, microhardness and microstructure (SEM, EDS, X-ray crystallography) tests have been carried out. Moreover, using techniques of computer image analysis, 
attributes such as CaF2 parts distribution, their size, shape, orientation and volume share have been computed. In the end resulting data have been elaborated 
statistically and interpreted.
