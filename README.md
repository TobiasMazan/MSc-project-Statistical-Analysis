__1. Project overview__

Existing friction theories donâ€™t allow to design behavior of tribological system, therefore conducting experimental research is essential.
In this paper Cu matrix composite material with the addition of CaF2 solid lubricant has been characterized. It was developed to work in hard conditions: 
high loads, temperatures and sliding velocities combined with corrosive environment. Mechanical and tribological properties of the material have been described; 
hardness, microhardness and microstructure (SEM, EDS, X-ray crystallography) tests have been carried out. Moreover, using techniques of computer image analysis, 
attributes such as CaF2 parts distribution, their size, shape, orientation and volume share have been computed. In the end resulting data have been elaborated 
statistically. Additionally this paper investigates formation mechanism of CaF2 tribofilm.
